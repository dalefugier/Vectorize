Vectorize uses the famous [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) by Peter Selinger, whose application transforms a bitmap into a soft, scalable image made up of vectors. 

### Prerequisites

The following tool is required to build Vectorize:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [Apple Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
 
Note, the solution uses the [RhinoCommon](https://www.nuget.org/packages/rhinocommon) package available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).
